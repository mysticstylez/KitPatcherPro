Kit Patcher Pro is a lightweight and user-friendly game launcher which offers essential features such as real-time server status checking, game file installation and updates, patch notes, menus, and seamless game launching. Players can easily stay informed about server news and availability, download the latest updates, and access patch notes and other menus before launching the game

This was originally designed as a closed environment dev tool for installing and updating a game client within a private group or studio. It will need some additional work to function as a commercial type tool. See roadmap.

Dependencies included in this package. If it's an issue then please reach out to me.

This package contains no license. Please do not redistribute modified versions or use for commercial use by itself. You're welcome to use in your projects or commercial game. Thank you.
